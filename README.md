Multiplayer javascript game using websockets.
Players are mining cryptocurrencies to a shared pool in the background while playing this game. Players compete with each other and the best players would get a portion of this mined pool of cryptocurrencies as a reward.
I developed this game in my individual study class at Kansas State University, my supervisor was Nathan Bean.
